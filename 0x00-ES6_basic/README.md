# Project Name: Curriculum Short Specializations

## Description
This project aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of ES6 (ECMAScript 2015) basics through short specializations. Each specialization focuses on a specific topic within ES6, providing theoretical knowledge and practical exercises.

## Specializations
- **ES6 Basics**: Covers fundamental concepts such as new features introduced in ES6, constants vs. variables, block-scoped variables, arrow functions, default parameters, rest parameters, string templating, object creation, and iterators.

## Timeline
- **Project Duration**: April 22, 2024, 6:00 AM to April 23, 2024, 6:00 AM
- **Checker Release**: April 22, 2024, 12:00 PM
- **Auto Review**: Launched at the deadline

## Learning Objectives
Upon completing this project, participants should be able to:
- Explain ES6 fundamentals and its new features
- Differentiate between constants and variables
- Understand block-scoped variables and arrow functions
- Utilize default and rest parameters effectively
- Apply ES6 string templating and object creation techniques
- Implement iterators and for-of loops in JavaScript

## Requirements
### General
- Execution environment: Ubuntu 18.04 LTS with NodeJS 12.11.x
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs, Visual Studio Code
- Files should end with a newline character
- Must include a mandatory README.md file in the project root
- Code should have .js extension
- Testing framework: Jest
- Code analysis tool: ESLint with specified rules

### Setup
1. Install NodeJS 12.11.x:
```
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_12.x -o nodesource_setup.sh
sudo bash nodesource_setup.sh
sudo apt install nodejs -y
```
Verify NodeJS and npm versions:
```
nodejs -v
npm -v
```
2. Install Jest, Babel, and ESLint by running `npm install` in the project directory.

### Configuration Files

- **babel.config.js**: Babel configuration
- **.eslintrc.js**: ESLint configuration

### Final Steps
Run `npm install` from the project terminal to install all necessary dependencies.

## Tasks
The project consists of several mandatory tasks covering ES6 basics, each task focusing on a specific concept such as constants, block scope, arrow functions, default parameters, rest parameters, spread syntax, template literals, object property shorthand, computed property names, method properties, and for...of loops.
